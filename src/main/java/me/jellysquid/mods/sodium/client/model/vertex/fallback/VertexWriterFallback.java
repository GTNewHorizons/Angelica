 * The base implementation for a {@link VertexSink} which writes to a black-boxed {@link VertexConsumer}. This is the
 * fallback path used when direct-writing optimizations cannot be used because the drain has no accessible backing
 * memory. This implementation is very slow and should be avoided where possible.
 *
 * This sink does not support explicit batching/flushing and as such, all written vertices are immediately flushed
 * to the backing implementation.
